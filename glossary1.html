                <h1>Repostory</h1>
                <p class="glossary">A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. You can own repositories individually, or you can share ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.</p>

                <h1>Branch</h1>
                <p class="glossary">A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master. This is the official working version of your project, and the one you see when you visit the project repository at github.com/yourname/projectname.</p>

                <h1>Clone</h1>
                <p class="glossary">When you create a repository on GitHub.com, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.</p>
